# Based on 
Tarmak-DH 2020 but in ISO config (so didn't take from here)

Diagram of how I changed in to ANSI (didn't change much just the angle z mod)

# Instructions

Based on whether you have an ANSI keyboard (there is no _ key left to your z key) or ISO keyboard (there is a "-" left to your z key), go the either ANSI or ISO folders to find the keyboard layouts that you need.


## Installation
Put the bundle into either directories:
- /Library/Keyboard Layouts aka Macintosh HD > Library > Keyboard Layouts if you want to install system-wide for all users (recommended). It should ask for your password to move it.
- ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts aka Macintosh HD > Users > USERNAME > Library > Keyboard Layouts if you want to install for only yourself, so the keyboards won't be used for sensitive inputs like password entry.

Go to system preferences, keyboard > input sources and use the + button in the bottom left corner to add the keyboards listed below:
- TarmakDH 1a.keylayout
- TarmakDH 1b.keylayout
- TarmakDH 2a.keylayout
- TarmakDH 2b.keylayout
- TarmakDH 3.keylayout
- TarmakDH 4.keylayout
- Colemak DH ANSI.keylayout

You can select multiple to add at once.


## Usage

Order of progression - I think you can skip past (a) to (b) layouts if you want
- TarmakDH 1a.keylayout
- TarmakDH 1b.keylayout
- TarmakDH 2a.keylayout
- TarmakDH 2b.keylayout
- TarmakDH 3.keylayout
- TarmakDH 4.keylayout
- Colemak DH ANSI.keylayout

Also if you are on a mac, you can actually turn on the keyboard viewer in keyboard preferences so you have the keyboard up for reference.

Additionally I have wallpapers you can use for each keyboard in the Wallpaper folder, you can make your own with the images in the Wallpaper/DIY folder or go to the top right corner (...), Customise "..." and add your own panes (I color each change to make it easier to find the swapped keys)

## End keyboard 
You should end with Colemak DH + Z angle mod. This is the same as  https://github.com/ColemakMods/mod-dh/tree/master/macOS

# Useful 
Added a Wallpaper of this keyboard config (it's just modified slightly from ISO config Tarmak-DH) credit to 
https://forum.colemak.com/topic/1858-learn-colemak-in-steps-with-the-tarmak-layouts/#p14801
for original images


# Future work
Different implementations of ANSI Colemak DH https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/keyboards.html#ansi-keyboards - Might want to do the wide mod.

## Tips
- Make sure you do the lower and uppercase when you customize in https://software.sil.org/ukelele/
- You can drag the keys in the app (speed up workflow)
- If you are duplicating a keyboard, remember to change the name
- Make a collection and export to get a .dmg, the bundle is inside.
- try to make your colored keyboard panels (checkout wallpaper folder to see example for each stage)

#FAQ
- It hasn't appeared in my system preferences: Log in and out. If that doesn't work check you have the TarmakDH ANSI Zmod.bundle in Macintosh HD > Library > Keyboard Layouts then restart.

- Clicking on it gives an error for Keyboard_Installer.KIErrorCode error 1. : Yes, have not figured out how to fix this. So only manual installation works now.

#TODO
- [X] ANSI keyboard
- [X] Wallpaper for ANSI
- [-] ISO keyboard
- [ ] Key fingering diagram
